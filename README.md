# keylogger
A Python-based keylogger script designed for educational and security testing purposes.


A lightweight Python keylogger that captures and logs keystrokes to a file (keyfile.txt) using the pynput library. The script listens for keystrokes and writes them into the log, handling exceptions for non-character keys. Designed for educational purposes, it demonstrates basic keylogging functionality and can be used for security research or testing under legal and ethical guidelines.
